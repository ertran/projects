The first prototype.  It's kept simple as the webpage iterates rather little from interaction.
Much of it is still up in the air as to how it can be created without knowing the code. The user
testing this prototype was quick to know what to do, though this is also the earlier stages and before
I add the interactions outside of the base game in the middle.  Not that the game itself reflects the end
product either. It's all difficult to say, given my topic.
