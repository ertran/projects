1. How will your users understand the content of the project?<br><br>

	Understanding will come through interaction and storytelling. The user will begin with limited knowledge of the content as a necessity.<br><br>


2. How will your user understand the primary objectives?<br><br>
	
The hope is for them to come to their own formulated conclusion about the topic by the end of the interaction. There may be some grey areas and some interpretations may differ from others. Hopefully it will not be too vague.<br><br>


3. What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?<br><br>

	The original plan may require some previous ability to do some critical thinking. The user will need some open mindedness and a rather firm grasp of online or computer interactions and interfacing.<br><br>


4. How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you or your team is creating?<br><br>

	I am aiming towards making this experience as interesting as possible, though doing so may limit the user base to those fairly familiar with computers, the internet, and how they tend to work. A less experienced user may still be able to figure these things out through experimentation, but may lose some of the meaning provided through unfamiliar jargon or chat phrasing.<br>
