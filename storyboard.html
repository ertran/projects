The first storyboard showing I'm more focused on a sit down and play computer screen over a tablet or phone,
but I'm considering both. The interface displayed in the 2nd shows the chat interacting with user during the puzzle.
There is a more focused talking in the third. Feedback had mentioned the use of tablets and phones as a side
interaction with the user, allowing actual human interaction and deception. Puzzles should also be a little
more clear and the chat interface should be well defined.

Second storyboard. I was thinking a bit more on the 2 player interaction and how that'll fit in
my original topic idea. I also divided the screen into more even proportions to emphasize the
chat as well as the puzzle. I also mentioned the idea of the game 'fighting back' with the user.
That self preservation would make the machine seem more human. Feedback had mentioned the possibility
of allowing the second person to govern the direction of the game, but also have the game fight both of them,
or lying to make it seem like the other player is harming the player. The chat may also not need to be
so large, it just has to be clear. The closing thing might bring up problems with accidents or just plain
need to leave. May need to use cookies, or just an auto save if possible. Or even save moments from prev attempt
and mention them in the new attempt, though the game starts over.
